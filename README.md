Deepfake is creating realistic forgeries that make people unable to distinguish reality from fiction, while filtering algorithms distort the perception by amplifying the interests of the user. From the way we perceive society to the way we perceive ourselves, the virtual environment is changing fundamental mechanisms of life. Due to the rapid growth of the virtual world and its hazy moral context, our society needs to build the groundwork of an ethical code for the online environment. Powerful technologies are used to produce art that captivates and impresses the general public. The artworks highlight ethical problems that our society is facing, creating a thoughtful space of analysis, experience and debate around the moral concerns in the technological era. This paper contains a short analysis on some of the main threats of artificial intelligence along with the proposal of art as a way to approach technology ethics on a large scale.
